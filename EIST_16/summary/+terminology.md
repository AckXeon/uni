# some terminology
- ***roundtrip engineering***
  - forward engineering + reverse engineering
- ***reengineering***
  - changing a software system after it has been reverse engineered
- ***falsification***
  - the act of disproving a theory or hypothesis

- ***inheritance in Java***
  - Realization of *specialization and generalization*
    - Definition of subclass
    - Java keyword: `extends`
  - Realization of *simple inheritance*
    - Overwriting of methods is not allowed
    - Java keyword: `final`
  - Realization of *implementation inheritance*
    - Overwriting of methods
    - No keyword necessary

  - Realization of *specification inheritance*
    - Specification of an interface

- ***use of models***
  - *Communication*: The model provides a common vocabulary. A model is communicated informally (“conceptual model”)
    - Target is a human being (developer, end user)
  - *Analysis and Design*: Models enable developers to specify and reason about a future system
    - Target is a tool (CASE tool, compiler)
  - *Archival*: Compact representation for storing the design and rationale of an existing system
    - Target is the human (analysis, project manager).

- ***problem statement -> system model***
  - Analyze the problem statement
    - Elicit and identify ***functional requirements***
    - Elicit and identify ***nonfunctional requirements***
    - Identify ***constraints*** (*pseudo requirements*)
  - Build the ***functional model***:
    - Develop ***use cases*** to illustrate functional requirements
  - Build the ***dynamic model***:
    - Develop sequence diagrams to illustrate the interaction between objects
    - Develop state diagrams for objects with interesting behavior
  - Build the ***object model***:
    - Develop class diagrams for the structure of the system.

- ***project***
  - consists of:  
    - a start date and duration
    - a set of deliverables
    - a schedule
    -  all technical and managerial activities requeired to produce and deliver the deliverables
    - resources consumed by the activities
    - a project is managed by a ***project manager***
