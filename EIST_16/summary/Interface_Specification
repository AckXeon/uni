## Object Design II: Specifying Interfaces
### Modeling constraints with contracts
- functional requirements are addresses during analysis
  - They can be modeled with use cases, class diagrams, etc
- nonfunctional requirements are addressed in system design
  - They can be modeled with deployment diagrams, communication diagrams, etc
- constraints are addressed during object design
  - There are constraints (“pseudo requirements”) which cannot be modeled in UML
  - they are modeled with ***contracts***

### design by contract
- design by contract is a detailed/object design approach
- it allows a formal interface specification for software components
  - a collection of pre- / postconditions and invariants

### ***contract***
- *Contract*: A lawful agreement between two parties in which both parties accept obligations and on which both parties can found their rights
- *Object-oriented contract*: Describes the services that are provided by an object if certain conditions are fulfilled
  - mapping  to law: services = “obligations”, conditions = “rights”
  - The remedy for breach of an OO-contract is the generation of an exception
- An *object-oriented contract* describes the *services* that are provided by an *object*. For each service, it describes two things:
  1. The *conditions* under which the service will be provided
  2. A *specification* of the result of the service that is provided
