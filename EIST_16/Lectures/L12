Class user: "call the class"
class implementor: "realize the class"
class extender: "refine the class"

## Interface Specification
1) Interface specification during requirements analysis
  - identification of attributes and operations
  - no need to specify types or their parameters
2) interface specification during object design
  - add type signature information
  - add visibility information
  - add contracts

### information hiding heuristics
- carefully define the public interface for classes as well as subsystems
- always apply the "need to know" principle
- the fewer details a class user has to know
  - the easier the class can be changed
  - the less likely the class user will be affected by any changes
- good rule: make attributes always private
- trade-off: information hiding vs. efficiency
