### State pattern
- the context is the class that can have a number of internal states, it presents a single interface to the outside world
- the state interface defines a common interface for all concrete states; the states all implement the same interface so they are interchangable
  - there are usually as many concrete states as there are internal states
- concrete states handle requests from the context and define state-specific behavior
- each concrete state provides its own implementations for a request. in this way, when the context changes state its behavior as well
